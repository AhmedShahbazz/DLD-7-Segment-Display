# 7-Segment Display Project

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the 7-Segment Display Project! This repository is designed to help you easily integrate and use 7-segment displays in your electronic projects. Our goal is to provide a straightforward interface and useful tools for both beginners and experienced hobbyists.

## Overview

A 7-segment display is a form of electronic display device used for displaying decimal numerals and a limited number of alphabetical characters (often used in digital clocks, electronic meters, and other devices where numerical data is displayed).

## Features

- **Simple Interface**: Functions and examples to control the display with minimal code.
- **Arduino Compatible**: Ready-to-use examples for Arduino boards.
- **Flexible**: Supports both common cathode and common anode displays.
- **Multiplexing Support**: Instructions and code for managing multiple digits.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Any microcontroller (Arduino, ESP8266, etc.)
- 7-segment displays (as many as your project requires)
- Appropriate resistors for limiting current
- Breadboard and jumper wires
- Optional: Transistors or MOSFETs for controlling multiple displays

## Usage

Refer to the `examples` directory for basic and advanced usage scripts. These include simple number display, counting scripts, and more complex multiplexing setups.
